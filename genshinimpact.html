        <h2>My Experience</h2>
   <p>I started Genshin back in 2022 and I have been addicted to the gameplay. All the characters in the game are unique and have their own playstyles, teams, and stories which I find really important in a video game's structure. The game does not get old due to new events and versions being released frequently.</p>
